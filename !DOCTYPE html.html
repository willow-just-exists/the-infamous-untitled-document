<p><b>note:</b><br>how many times is it gonna say that she has horns? I knew it was a lot, but dam</p>

<p><b>another note:</b><br>
	the amount of times I’ve read her being described as ‘nurse to all’ is crazy. I think its safe to assume she was identified as some sort of healing goddess (?) especially being identified with Artemis closer to the Roman time, but take all this with a (several) grain(s) of salt. I have no idea what I’m talking about, but pregnancies were measured by 9 lunar cycles, and she was also a goddess of childbirth.</p>

<p><b>yet another note:</b><br>
	again, take this with several grains of salt, but the horns might represent the crescent of the moon (?) or just because she leads a team of oxen and it makes her seem a bit more divine. In lots of the art I’ve seen instead of having bulls horns she has a crescent over her head</p>

<p><b>holy cow, another note:</b><br>
	she also seems to often have her veil billowing over her head. No idea for certain what the symbolism is.</p>

	"Soon as the moon [Luna-Selene] gathers her returning fires, if she encloses a dark mist within dim horns, a heavy rain is awaiting farmers and seamen.

	"[Juno-Hera] encountering the lunar team she faced them and spoke thus with calm accents : ‘Grant me a little boon, O Cynthia [Selene the Moon], if Juno [Hera] can command respect . . . now canst thou do me a service.
