<p><b>note:</b><br>how many times is it gonna say that she has horns? I knew it was a lot, but dam</p>

<p><b>another note:</b><br>
	the amount of times I’ve read her being described as ‘nurse to all’ is crazy. I think its safe to assume she was identified as some sort of healing goddess (?) especially being identified with Artemis closer to the Roman time, but take all this with a (several) grain(s) of salt. I have no idea what I’m talking about, but pregnancies were measured by 9 lunar cycles, and she was also a goddess of childbirth.</p>

<p><b>yet another note:</b><br>
	again, take this with several grains of salt, but the horns might represent the crescent of the moon (?) or just because she leads a team of oxen and it makes her seem a bit more divine. In lots of the art I’ve seen instead of having bulls horns she has a crescent over her head</p>

<p><b>holy cow, another note:</b><br>
	she also seems to often have her veil billowing over her head. No idea for certain what the symbolism is.</p>

	"Dionysos (Dionysus) waited for darksome night, and appealed in these words to circle Mene (Moon) [Selene] in heaven : ‘O daughter of Helios (the Sun), Mene of many turnings, nurse of all! O Selene, driver of the silver car! If thou art Hekate (Hecate) of many names, <mark style="background-color:#fbfd76">if in the night thou doest shake thy mystic torch</mark> in brandcarrying hand, come nightwanderer . . . If thou art staghunter Artemis, if on the hills thou dost eagerly hunt with fawnkilling Dionysos, be thy brother's helper now! . . . I am being chased out of Thebes [by Pentheus] . . . a mortal man, a creature quickly perishing, an enemy of god, persecutes me. As a being of night, help Dionysos of the night, when they pursue me! If thou art Persephoneia, whipperin of the dead, and yours are the ghosts which are subservient to the throne of Tartaros, let me see Pentheus a dead man, and let Hermes thy musterer of ghosts lull to sleep the tears of Dionysos in his grief. With Tartarean whip of thy Tisiphone, or furious Megaira (Megaera), stop the foolish threats of Pentheus . . .’
To this appeal Mene [Selene] answered on high : ‘Night-illuminating Dionysos, friend of plants, comrade of Mene, look to your grapes; my concern is the mystic rites of Bakkhos (Bacchus), for the earth ripens the offspring of your plants when it receives the dewy sparkles of unresting Selene. Then do you, dancing Bakkhos, stretch out your thyrsos and look to your offspring; and you need not fear a race of puny men, whose mind is light, whose threats the whips of the Eumenides [Erinyes] repress perforce. With you I will attack your enemies. Equally with Bakkhos I rule distracted madness. I am the Bakkhic Mene, not alone because in heaven I turn the months, but because I command madness and excite lunacy. I will not leave unpunished earthly violence against you . . .’
Such was the answer of the goldenrein deity to Bromios. But while Bakkhos yet conversed with circling Mene, even then Persephone was arming her Erinyes."</p>
