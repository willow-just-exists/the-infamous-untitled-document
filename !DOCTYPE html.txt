<p><b>note:</b><br>how many times is it gonna say that she has horns? I knew it was a lot, but dam</p>

<p><b>another note:</b><br>
	the amount of times I’ve read her being described as ‘nurse to all’ is crazy. I think its safe to assume she was identified as some sort of healing goddess (?) especially being identified with Artemis closer to the Roman time, but take all this with a (several) grain(s) of salt. I have no idea what I’m talking about, but pregnancies were measured by 9 lunar cycles, and she was also a goddess of childbirth.</p>

<p><b>yet another note:</b><br>
	again, take this with several grains of salt, but the horns might represent the crescent of the moon (?) or just because she leads a team of oxen and it makes her seem a bit more divine. In lots of the art I’ve seen instead of having bulls horns she has a crescent over her head</p>

<p><b>holy cow, another note:</b><br>
	she also seems to often have her veil billowing over her head. No idea for certain what the symbolism is.</p>

<p>Aelian, On Animals 12. 7 (trans. Scholfield) (Greek natural history C2nd A.D.) :<br>
	"They say that the Lion of Nemea fell from the moon (selene). At any rate Epimenides [C6th B.C. poet] also has these words : ‘For I am sprung from <mark>fair-tressed Selene the Moon,</mark> who in a fearful shudder shook off the savage lion in Nemea, and brought him forth at the bidding of Queen Hera.’"</p>

<p>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 1. 214 ff :<br>
	"[The monster Typhoeus laid siege to heaven, challenging the rule of Zeus :] Many a time he [Typhoeus] took a bull at rest from his rustic plowtree and shook him with a threatening hand, bellow as he would, then shot him against Selene the Moon like another moon, and stayed her course, then rushed hissing against the goddess, checking with the bridle her bulls' white yoke-straps, while he poured out the mortal whistle of a poison-spitting viper. But Titanis Mene [Selene] would not yield to the attack. Battling against the Gigante's (Giant's) heads, like horned to hers <mark>[i.e. Selene was crowned with horns with the disc between them forming the circle of the moon--with these she locked horns with one of Typhoeus' bull-heads],</mark> she carved many a scar on the shining orb of her bull's horn <mark>[i.e the smooth white surface of the moon was scarred by this battle];</mark> and Selene's radiant cattle bellowed amazed at the gaping chasm of Typhaon's throat."</p>

<hr>

<p>Homeric Hymn 32 to Selene (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th B.C.) :<br>
	<mark>"Long-winged Mene</mark> [i.e. Selene as goddess of the month]. From her immortal head a radiance is shown from heaven and embraces earth; and great is the beauty that ariseth from her shining light. The air, unlit before, glows with the light of her <mark>golden crown,</mark> and her rays beam clear, whensoever bright Selene (the Moon) having bathed her lovely body in the waters of Okeanos (Oceanus), <mark>and donned her far-gleaming raiment,</mark> and yoked her strong-necked, shining team, and drives on her long-maned horses at full speed, at eventime in the mid-month : then her great orbit is full and then her beams shine brightest as she increases. So she is a sure token and a sign to mortal men."</p>

<p>Sappho, Fragment 96 :<br>
	<mark>"Rosy-fingered Selene (the Moon)</mark> after sunset, surpasssing all the stars (astra), and her light spreads alike over the salt sea and the flowery fields; the dew is shed in beauty, and roses bloom and tender chervil and flowery melilot."</p>

<p>Quintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 1. 147 ff (trans. Way) (Greek epic C4th A.D.) :<br>
	"Swelled like young Mene's (the Moon's) [Selene's] arching chariot-rail when high o'er Okeanos' (Oceanus') fathomless-flowing stream she rises, with the space half filled with light betwixt her <mark>bowing horns."</mark></p>

	"The dog-star [Seirios (Sirius)] is extinguished by the watery snowstorms. For even the stars go pale before their streams, <mark>no longer do we see the Moon (mênê) [Selene], the dark-eyed lady</mark> (potnia kyanôpis) that treads upon the heel of the sun, who is frozen among the clouds ((lacuna)) . . no longer did the redness of the dawn embrace the circle of the night . . . <mark>The glow of the ox-eyed moon</mark> (boôpis selênê)."</p>

<p>Virgil, Georgics 1. 426 ff :<br>
	"Soon as the moon [Luna-Selene] gathers her returning fires, if she encloses a dark mist within dim horns, a heavy rain is awaiting farmers and seamen. But if over her face she spreads a maiden blush, there will be wind; as wind rises, golden Phoebe [Luna-Selene] ever blushes. But if at her fourth rising--for that is our surest guide--she pass through the sky clear and with <mark>undimmed horns,</mark> then all that day, and the days born of it to the month's end, shall be free from rain and wind; and the sailors, safe in port."</p>

<p>Seneca, Medea 95 ff :<br>
	"So does starlight splendour wane with the coming of the sun, and the huddled flock of the Pleiades vanish away when Phoebe [Selene the Moon], shining with borrowed light [i.e. from the sun], with <mark>encircling horns encloses her full-orbed disk."</mark></p>
    
<hr>

<p>Seneca, Phaedra 417 ff :<br>

<hr>

<p>Seneca, Phaedra 742 ff :<br>
	"As much fairer does thy beauty shine as gleams more brightly the full-orbed moon when with <mark>meeting horns</mark> she has joined her fires, when at the full with speeding chariot blushing Phoebe [Selene the Moon] shows her face and the lesser stars fade out of sight."</p>

<p>Statius, Thebaid 12. 1 ff :<br>
	"Not ye had the wakeful dawn put all the stars to flight from heaven, and Luna (the Moon) [Selene] was beholding the approach of day with <mark>fading horn."</mark></p>
    
<hr>

<p>Statius, Thebaid 12. 300 ff :<br>
	"[Juno-Hera] encountering the lunar team she faced them and spoke thus with calm accents : ‘Grant me a little boon, O Cynthia [Selene the Moon], if Juno [Hera] can command respect . . . now canst thou do me a service. Argia, daughter of Inachus, my favourite votary--seest thou in what a night she roams [in search of the unburied body of her husband Polyneikes (Polynices) on the battlefields of Thebes], nor with failing strength can find her spouse in the thick darkness? Thy beams too are faint with shrouding vapour; <mark>show forth thy horns,</mark> I pray thee, and let thy orbit approach the earth nearer than is thy wont. This Sopor [Hypnos, sleep], too, who leaning forward plies for thee thy humid chariot-reins, send him upon the Aonian watchmen.’</p>
    
	<p>Scarce had she spoken, when the goddess cleft the clouds and displayed her mighty orb; the shadows started in terror, and the stars shorn of their radiance; scarce did Saturnia [Hera] herself endure the brightness."</p>

<p>Musaeus, Hero & Leander 56 (Greek poetry C5th or 6th A.D.) :<br>
	"Flashing a lightning of lovely radiance from her face, even as <mark>Selene of the fair white cheeks,</mark> when she is rising."</p>
    
<hr>

<p>Tryphiodorus, The Taking of Ilias 514 (trans. Mair) (Greek poetry C6th A.D.) :<br>
"When Mene (the Moon) [Selene], full with grey fire, gilds with her face the gleaming heaven: not when, <mark>sharpening her pointed horns,</mark> she first shines, rising in the shadowless dusk of the month, but when, orbing the round radiance of her eye, she draws to herself the reflected rays of the sun."</p>

<p>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 5. 67 ff :<br>
	"He [Kadmos (Cadmus) founder of Thebes] dedicated the seven gates [of the new-founded city] to the seven planets. First towards the western clime he allotted the Onkaian (Oncaean) Gate to Mene (the Moon) [Selene] brighteyes, taking the name from the honk of cattle, <mark>because Selene herself, bullshaped, horned, driver of cattle,</mark> being triform is Tritonis Athene."</p>

<p>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 17. 234 ff :<br>
	"Orontes [an Indian chief] proud of his armament struck Bakkhos (Bacchus) [Dionysos] on the top of his head, but wounded him not; he grazed the sharp horn of Bromios all for nothing. For Lord Dionysos wore on that invulnerable head . . . the shape of the <mark>bullfaced Selene the Moon . . . Lyaios (Lyaeus) wore the heavenly image of the cow's eye Selene,</mark> a growth of divine horns which cannot be broken, which enemies cannot shake."</p>
    
<hr>

<p>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 23. 280 ff :<br>
	"[Okeanos (Oceanus) threatens to divert his streams through heaven :] ‘Selene (the Moon) herself, <mark>bullshaped and horned</mark> driver of cattle, may be angry to see my horned bullshaped form.’"</p>
    
<hr>

<p>Ovid, Metamorphoses 7. 179 ff :<br>
	"Three nights remained before Luna's (the Moon's) [Selene's] <mark>bright horns</mark> would meet and form her orb; then when she shone in fullest radiance and with form complete gazed down upon the sleeping lands below, [the witch] Medea, barefoot, her long robe unfastened, her hair upon her shoulders falling loose, went forth alone upon her roaming way, in the deep stillness of the midnight hour [to make her magics]."</p>
